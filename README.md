# AI agent that finds the best path to the goal while avoiding traps. Uses the Q-Learning algorithm.

##### In this project, we developed model-free learning.
- In this method, the agent does not know the rewards and moves randomly around the world until it reaches the Goal, thus completing an episode.
- After each episode, the Q Learning table is updated. This table contains rewards for each possible action in each possible state, which are calculated from the Goal to the initial position for each episode.
- After all episodes are completed, arrows are marked on the board to indicate the best action to take in each state.

###### Note: 
To make each episode ‘faster,’ in the client.py file, you can change the sleep_t parameter in the execute method of the Client class and set it to 0.
